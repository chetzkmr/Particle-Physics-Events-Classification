# Particle-Physics-Events-Classification
Particle Physics Event Classification Project

Welcome to the Particle Physics Event Classification Project GitHub repository!
Overview:

This repository hosts the code and documentation for a particle physics event classification project. The primary objective of this project is to classify particle physics events accurately using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project initially contained error data marked as -999, which required preprocessing before model training. Additionally, the target feature in the dataset was imbalanced, necessitating the application of techniques such as random undersampling to balance the classes.
Project Structure:

    Data Preprocessing:
        The dataset was preprocessed to handle error data (-999) and address any missing values.
        Imbalanced target feature was balanced using the random undersampling method to ensure the 
        models were trained on balanced datasets.

    Model Development:
        Various machine learning models were implemented, including:
            Logistic Regression
            XGBoost
            K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
            Naive Bayes
            Random Forest
            Stacking models
        Each model was fine-tuned and optimized to achieve the best possible performance.

    Handling Overfitting:
        Techniques such as ridge regularization and adjusting the number of estimators were 
        employed to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization.

    Model Evaluation:
        Model performance was evaluated using classification reports, which provided insights into the precision, recall, and F1-score of each model.
        Cross-validation techniques were utilized to assess the robustness and accuracy of the models across different subsets of the data.
